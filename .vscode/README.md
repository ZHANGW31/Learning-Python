All of my learning, practices and experimental code will be in this folder!  

booleanStringTests.py shows booleans being used in Python, through the usage of the .isalpha, .isalnum functions.  

FunctionWithArguments.py shows the use of functions with arguments through the utilization of the print() function and multiple arguments.  
FunctionWithReturnValue.py shows demonstrates functions returning a value. The example used for this demonstration is the type() function which returns the type of object that was enclosed in the parenthesis.

hello.py is the simple and iconic hello world application with Python!

inputMethod.py contains the demonstration of getting user input via the input() function. You may also print and store the string that the user enters.
